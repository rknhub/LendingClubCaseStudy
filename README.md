## General Information
- In the consumer finance industry, making accurate loan approval decisions is crucial. For a company that specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers, two main risks are associated:

Loss of Business: If a loan is not approved for an applicant who would have repaid it, the company misses out on business.
Financial Loss: If a loan is approved for an applicant who defaults, the company incurs financial losses.
The challenge is to predict whether an applicant is likely to repay the loan or default, thus aiding in making informed loan approval decisions.
The aim of this project is to identify patterns and predictors that indicate the likelihood of an applicant defaulting on a loan. Insights derived from this analysis will help in making decisions such as:

Denying the loan to high-risk applicants, Reducing the loan amount, Adjusting interest rates for riskier loans.

Comparative analysis of various models highlighted the trade-offs between model complexity and predictive accuracy.
